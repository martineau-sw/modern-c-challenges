/*
 * CHALLENGE 6 Linear algebra
 *
 * Some of the most important problems for which arrays are used stem from linear algebra.
 *
 * Can you write functions that do vector-to-vector or matrix-to-vector products at this point?
 *
 * What about Gau√ü elimination or iterative algorithms for matrix inversion?
