# Challenge 2: Differentiation

### Specifications[^1]

- Implement numerical derivative `double f(double x)` of function `double
  F(double x)`

### Reflection

This challenge and the next excited me. It's familiar math that I haven't
thought to intersect with programming. I'm always on the look out for
generalization, whether of simple operations to more complex topologies. I found
a nice intersection which, while not covered in the text at this point, gave a
perfect introduction to the concept of function pointers. The usage was simple
enough to implement without becoming too anxious about the granular details.
With that being said, caution was to the wind with this one. I'm sure there are
some checks that need to be preformed before going through with such an idea and
I'll return once I'm not ignorant to them.
