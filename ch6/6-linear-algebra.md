# Challenge 6: Linear Algebra

### Specifications[^1]

- Vector-to-vector product 
- Matrix-to-vector product
- Gaussian elimination
- Matrix inversion

### Reflection

The scale of perceived difficulty of this challenge was somewhere in the middle.
While I do have some math under my belt like calculus and discrete, I am not
studied in linear. This surfaced as having enough of an understanding to fill in
some gaps in my knowledge, but the gap is large enough that supplementary
material is not sufficient to close it. This led to seeking out an existing
Gaussian elimination implementation[^2] instead of trying to build a bridge from 
the raw mathematics myself.

##### 10 April 2024

I decided to stop at Gaussian elimination leaving matrix inversion incomplete 
for the sake of keeping momentum. I will return to this challenge at some point 
in the near future as I have for prior challenges.
