# Challenge 6 

### Specifications

- Vector-to-vector product 
- Matrix-to-vector product
- Gaussian elimination
- Matrix inversion

### Reflection

The scale of perceived difficulty of this challenge was somewhere in the middle.
While I do have some math under my belt like calculus and discrete, I am not
studied in linear. This surfaced as having enough of an understanding to fill in
some gaps in my knowledge, but the gap is large enough that supplementary
material is not sufficient to close it. This led to seeking out an
[Gaussian elimination implementation that exists][1] instead of trying to build
a bridge from raw mathematics myself.

As of 10 April 2024, I decided to stop at Gaussian elimination leaving matrix
inversion incomplete for the sake of keeping momentum. I will return to this
challenge at some point in the near future as I have for prior challenges.
