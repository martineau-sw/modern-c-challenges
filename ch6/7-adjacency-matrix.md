# Challenge 7: Adjacency Matrix

### Specifications

- Adjacency matrix of an unweighted graph
- Breadth-First Search algorithm
- Find connected verticies
- Find a spanning tree

### Reflection

##### First Impressions

The standout lesson from all of these challenges is that I desperately need to
brush up on my math. Thankfully, plenty of resources are available to hone in
on specific topics, but at times it feels that I'm getting such a small piece
of the picture. There is a level of intuition that can be utilized in all of
these problems but they're designed in such a way where intuition falls short
for me. Hats off to you, Gustedt. Now I *have* to learn something.
