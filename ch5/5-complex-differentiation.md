# Challenge 5: Complex Differentiation

### Specifications[^1]

- Extend the derivate (challenge 2) to the complex domain

### Reflection

This challenge is the easiest so far. My thoughts remain the same as they do in
challenge 2. Based on the wikipedia for complex differentiation, the definition
for a complex derivative differs in that the set of inputs (and thus set of
outputs) lies in the complex plain. I suppose I could look into checking if a
function is *differentiable* but have to keep the momentum.
